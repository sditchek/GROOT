# GROOT

## What Is GROOT?
GROOT stands for GRaphics for OSEs and OSSEs on TCs. It is a visualization package for Observing System Experiments (OSEs) and Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) that use HWRF, the Basin-Scale HWRF, or the FV3GFS with a focus on tropical cyclone (TC) verification.

## What Capabilities Are Included?
GROOT has a hurricane component (GROOT-H) and a global component (GROOT-G). Both still focus on TC verification, but their usage depends on what model is being used.

### GROOT-H

Use this component if you are running HWRF or the basin-scale HWRF. It has four main features:

  1) **Error Statistics Capability:** graphics for individual storms, composites, and various subsets are generated
  2) **Assimilated Observations Capability:** graphics for individual storms and storm-relative composites are generated
  3) **GRB Capability:** plan-view and azimuthally-averaged graphics for individual storms for each experiment and difference graphics between experiments are generated
  4) **Retrieval Scripts:** shell scripts are included that grab down all required files for error statistics, assimilated observations, and GRB graphics from HPSS

### GROOT-G

Use this component if you are running the FV3GFS. It has only one feature at the moment - the Error Statistics Capability. The Assimilated Observations Capability, GRB Capability, and Retrieval Scripts will be added in the future as a new release:

  - **Error Statistics Capability:** graphics for individual storms, composites, and various subsets are generated   
  
 ## Why Use GROOT?
  1) **It's Comprehensive:** results for both individual storms and composite studies are generated, retrieval scripts to grab GROOT-required files from HPSS are provided, and capabilities are continuously being added
  2) **Project Flexibility:** user input is confined to a brief namelist, any number of experiments can be compared (recommended maximum: 6), customization of colors and of baseline model available in the namelist, it works with model output from HWRF, the basin-scale HWRF, and FV3GFS, and users can switch between GROOT-H and GROOT-G with ease â€“ the same process is used to run both components
  3) **Uniformity:** uniform, publication-ready graphics are generated, and graphics generated are those that are often needed in OS(S)E studies that evaluate TC performance

  ## How To Use GROOT
  
  Checkout the code and read the README within either the GROOT-H or GROOT-G directories, depending on which component you'll be using.
