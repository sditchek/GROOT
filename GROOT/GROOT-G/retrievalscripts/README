PROCESS CONVENTIONAL OBSERVATIONS: gsi_diag_conv.f90
1) Edit gsi_diag_conv.f90 - note that you need to make sure that the columns match how the diag file was created (setupxxx.f90 in ProdGSI source code)
2) Compile the file: gfortran -c gsi_diag_conv.f90
3) Create the executable: gfortran -o gsi_diag_conv.x gsi_diag_conv.o
4) Nothing else! The gsi_diag_conv.x file will be used by the rtrv_conv_tmplt.sh script!
