%% SUMMARY %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS A VISUALIZATION PACKAGE FOR OBSERVING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS (OSES) AND OBSERVING SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS (OSSES) THAT USE HWRF OR THE BASIN-SCALE HWRF. 
THE MAIN CAPABILITIES OF THIS GRAPHICS PACKAGE ARE TO GENERATE:
  1) ERROR STATISTICS (E.G., ERRORS/IMPROVEMENT/BIAS/FSP OF TRACK, INTENSITY, PRESSURE, TC SIZE)
  2) ASSIMILATED OBSERVATION GRAPHICS (I.E., THE EARTH-RELATIVE AND STORM-RELATIVE LOCATION OF THE OBSERVATION TYPE YOU ARE TESTING) 
  3) STORM-CENTERED DIFFERENCES OF ANY FIELD OUTPUTTED BY THE MODEL
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS PACKAGE CAN BE USED FOR OSES/OSSES WITH ANY NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS, WITH USER INPUT BEING CONFINED TO A BRIEF NAMELIST - EVERYTHING ELSE IS AUTOMATED.

2) Edit the user settings section of editverif.m for the cases you want to include
3) Edit the user settings section of runverif.ksh - follow the instructions carefully or it won't run
4) Load the matlab module (module load matlab) - this isn't included in the batch scripts in case there is an issue/conflict with your other loaded modules
5) Submit runverif.ksh to batch: sbatch ./runverif.ksh

STORM-CENTERED GRAPHICS CAPABILITY - YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL THE ENTIRE STORM HAS FINISHED TO RUN THIS CAPABILITY.
1) If you had scrubbing turned ON, first run the retrieval script to download the files needed by the package. This is in the retrievalscripts/ directory. Read the README first.
2) Edit the user settings section of editgrb.m for the one storm you're running this capability for
3) Edit the user settings section of rungrb.ksh - follow the instructions carefully or it won't run
4) Load the matlab module (module load matlab) - this isn't included in the batch scripts in case there is an issue/conflict with your other loaded modules

%%  KEY POINTS  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

VERIFICATION CAPABILITY:
1) Significance is displayed on error-statistic graphics as squares (95%) and circles (90%) wrt the identexpsigimp - this detail is not included on the graphics in order to save space.
2) Every time you run this capability, if you ran the capability for the same set of experiments previously, those results are deleted. This is to ensure that your results include the most up-to-date data.

GRB CAPABILITY:
1) Only the SYNOPTIC and STORM grids are used for the grb capability. 
      A) The SYNOPTIC grid covers the same domain as the GLOBAL grid, but has a higher resolution than the GLOBAL grid.
      B) The STORM grid has the same resolution as the CORE grid, but has a larger domain than the CORE grid.
2) In the HWRFDA section, since the output of the pre-GSI and post-GSI grids are on hybrid levels, plan-view graphics and azimuthally-averaged graphics are taken at the average pressure over ocean in the entire domain at each level. This caveat is not written on graphics to save space, but an asterik is included next to the word "Pressure" so that a note can be included in a caption or on a slide.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  NEW ADDITIONS!  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

2/6/22   | Minor aesthetic fixed (e.g., switched text file name to match stratification name)
	 | Modified how track bias graphics were being produced to fall under "trk" file names
1/31/22  | Added median error and improvement to "scorecard" graphics
	 | Added a "consistency scorecard" which identifies at each forecast lead time how consistent the results are based on 3 metrics - see User's Guide for more details
12/30/21 | Enlarged the sample size text from 10 to 14
	 | Fixed a bug with the cycle-by-cycle error graphics for across-error and along-track error
	 | Made the graphic naming convention for pressure consistent (prior: press or pres | current: prs)
	 | Fixed a bug with the "generate your own subset" code
11/30/21 | Added capability to plot the mean and median storm-by-storm improvement (multiple storms) and cycle-by-cycle improvement (individual storm)
	 | Fixed a bug with the PPC graphics so that forecast hours without data plot as blanks instead of 0%
	 | Added "Mean" and "Median" title identifiers to the 1) Error and Improvement and 2) Storm-By-Storm graphics
	 | Fixed a bug to ensure that R34-R64 and FSP Removed were homogeneous samples
11/18/21 | Added capability to calculate the separation time between serially-correlated forecasts at each forecsat hour based on a user-designated explained variance threshold in the namel           ist in order to calculate an effective sample size for use in statistical significance calculations
	 | Updated the bdecks to the latest output, fixed missing data for storm names, and grabbed JTWC bdecks for IO, SH, and WP which has TC category designation
11/1/21  | Added capability for customization of the end limit of the forecast lead time x-axes.
10/28/21 | Added capability for the combo error/improvement graphics to produce both a mean and a median version as another way aside from FSP and PPC graphics to identify sample outliers
	 | Added capability to choose what serial correlation value to use in the namelist
	 | Added capability to choose what obstype to use in the namelist
	 | Due to changes to Hera, GRB scripts now include an --exclusive flag so that memory issues do not occur
	 | GRB scripts have been modified so that each experiment is run in a separate batch script so timeouts don't occur
10/18/21 | Fixed a bug that included SS and SD in the TD and TS stratifications
	 | Flipped the y-axis for the individual cycle graphics to match the PPC graphics
	 | Added capability to keep folders of invests or storms that do not satisfy NHC verfication
	 | Confirmed that the OBS/ folder graphics included all storms not just those that satisfied NHC verification
9/20/21  | Optimized code to use less resources, fixed bug that didn't allow storms with 1 cycle completed to plot, added a switch to turn off lagged correlation graphics to save time, 
           changed the errorskill graphic's aspect ratio to match those of other graphics, modified track graphics to be same resolution as other graphics and included additional guidance
7/30/21  | Added a new graphic that shows a "scorecard" of the error, improvement, bias, fsp, # fcsts, and stat. sig. for 7 variables (track, wind speed, mslp, R34, R50, R64, & RMW. 
           A huge thank you and shoutout to Dr. Peter Marinescu for originating the idea and generating the base code for the scorecard that I then modified for integration into GROOT! 
6/22/21  | Added a new graphic that shows the percentage point contribution (PPC) of each cycle to the full storm AND for each storm to the composite improvement
	 | Modified the batch scripts to break up the composite script where only 20 subsets run per batch job so that the wall clock time doesn't run out
	 | Modified the blank graphics capability when not enough data is available so that an equal number of graphics are generated for each storm and for each basin
6/09/21  | Added a new graphic that shows the percent contribution of each cycle to each storm's error - this helps the user understand which cycle might be driving the storm errors
         | Added new graphics to identify the lagged correlation in the model for each storm and overall for every variable and subset
	 | Added the ability to have track w/ assimilated obs graphics for each experiment, not just overall
	 | Modified the error & improvement combined graphic so that the aspect ratio of each are identical
	 | Modified the individual storm xlim range to match the max forecast length for easier comparision between storms
	 | Various bug fixes and minor changes (e.g., subsets with -B > -P for basin-scale models to indicate parent domain, for clarity) 
4/23/21  | Imported SHIPS data to generate shear stratifications for SHDC: 850-200 hPa shear magnitude (kt) with vortex removed and averaged from 0-500 km relative to 850 hPa vortex center
	   Stratifications include LOW (lower quartile), MOD (interquartile range), and HIGH (upper quartile), where values are determined by the t=0 climatology for each basin separately
	 | Significantly sped up script execution
4/14/21  | Added some new subsets for basin models 
	 | Added the ability to plot an empty graphic if a subset has no data
	 | Made a nomenclature change: MN > H12 & MJ > H345
	 | Added a new graphic that shows the number of cycles from each storm that contributes to a graphic each forecast hour
	 | Fixed a bug that occured for some "by cycle" subset graphics - this did not impact composite graphics
3/26/21  | A new graphic type which depicts both error & improvement - this is useful if you have a lot of examples you want to show in a small space (either presentation or paper)
3/10/21  | RI, IN, SS, WK, and RW intensity change stratifications are now available. 
           NOTE: For the BT of a given storm, a running -6 h to +6 h intensity change is calculated to capture what type of intensity change the storm is currently undergoing. 
		 Then, for cycles where at t=0 that value is...
		 x>=15 kt: categorize as RI
		 5<=x<15 kt: categorize as IN
		 -5<x<5 kt: categorize as SS
		 -15<x<=5 kt: categorize as WK
		 x<=-15 kt: categorize as RW
         | A bug fix which impacted basin-scale models when generating composite graphics of assmilated observations - it now takes into account storms in the entire basin
	 | The y-axes for a given variable will be identical for all stratifications not just within one basin, but across all basins in your sample for easier comparision
02/09/21 | Package v1.0.0 ready for distribution to OSA!
