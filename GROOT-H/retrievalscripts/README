FILES IN THIS FOLDER
  README                   | this file which explains how to edit and compile the the gsi scripts and how to run the retrieval script
  iscyclecomplete.ksh      | this file produces text files telling you and the retrieval script which cycles are completed
  gsi_diag_conv.f90        | this is the file you'd edit if you wanted to retrieve gsidiag files
  rtrv_conv_tmplt_hwrf.sh  | this script retrieves the needed files for the package to run when conducting experiments with non-radiance data and puts them in the proper directory structure
	                     (as if scrubbing was turned off).
  gsi_diag_rad.x           | this executable reads radiances from gsidiag files
  rtrv_rad_tmplt_hwrf.sh   | this script retrieves the needed files for the package to run when conducting experiments with radiance data and puts them in the proper directory structure 
                             (as if scrubbing was turned off).
  rtrv_conv_tmplt_hafs.sh  | this script retrieves the needed files for the package to run when conducting experiments with non-radiance data and puts them in the proper directory structure
                             (as if scrubbing was turned off).
  RAD/ 		           | folder with files needed to run gsi_diag_rad.x (namelist.rad) and files needed to grab qc flags for satellite obs (.pro scripts)
  HWRFDA.ksh               | this script (and crontab line within script) will retrieve pre-GSI and post-GSI grids while running the model before being scrubbed and put them in a separate folder

RUN TO SEE WHEN CYCLES COMPLETE AND TO IDENTIFY WHAT CYCLES SHOULD BE GRABBED BY RETRIEVAL SCRIPT: iscyclecomplete.ksh 
1) Edit iscyclecomplete.ksh 
2) Add a line to your crontab to run once a day (I usually have this set to 5am I can see what finished when I wake up)
3) You can also run this any time during the day by doing ./iscyclescomplete.ksh twice on the command line. Running it twice ensures that the files needed for the retrieval scripts are updated.

FOR HWRF: PROCESS CONVENTIONAL OBSERVATIONS: gsi_diag_conv.f90
1) Edit gsi_diag_conv.f90 - note that you need to make sure that the columns match how the diag file was created (setupxxx.f90 in ProdGSI source code); you should also ensure that the first three columns will be the obsname, obstype#, and subtype#.
2) Compile the file: gfortran -c gsi_diag_conv.f90
3) Create the executable: gfortran -o gsi_diag_conv.x gsi_diag_conv.o
4) Nothing else! The gsi_diag_conv.x file will be used by the rtrv_conv_tmplt.sh script!

HOW TO GET FILES FROM HPSS: rtrv_conv_tmplt_hafs.sh, rtrv_conv_tmplt_hwrf.sh, or rtrv_rad_tmplt_hwrf.sh   
1) For experiments on conventional observations: cp rtrv_conv_tmplt.sh <year>_<stormname><stormid>.ksh
   For experiments on radiance observations: cp rtrv_rad_tmplt.sh <year>_<stormname><stormid>.ksh
2) Edit <year>_<stormname><stormid>.ksh and change the top section [ACCOUNT (-A), EMAIL (--mail-user), OUTPUT (-o), and ERROR (-e)] as well as the USER SETTINGS section, only
3) Submit the script: sbatch ./<year>_<stormname><stormid>.ksh $1 | $1 is the subexp name without quotes (e.g., HB20_B1_ALL)

HOW TO GET PRE-GSI AND POST-GSI GRIDS: HWRFDA.ksh - you need to have this running before starting your experiments
1) Open the HWRFDA.ksh script and change the top section [ACCOUNT (-A), EMAIL (--mail-user), OUTPUT (-o), and ERROR (-e)] as well as the USER SETTINGS section, only
2) There is a suggested, commented out crontab line in the script. By adding that line (uncommented) to your crontab, it will pull the pre- and post- files while you are running your model

HOW TO SUBMIT AND CANCEL A BATCH SCRIPT
1) Submitting SBATCH: sbatch <script>
2) Canceling SBATCH: scancel <jobID> - type sqm to get jobID
