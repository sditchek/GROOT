%% SUMMARY %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS A VISUALIZATION PACKAGE FOR OBSERVING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS (OSES), OBSERVING SYSTEM SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS (OSSES), NEW MODELING SYSTEMS, AND MODEL UPGRADES THAT USE HWRF, THE BASIN-SCALE HWRF, or HAFS.
THE MAIN CAPABILITIES OF THIS GRAPHICS PACKAGE ARE TO GENERATE:
  1) ERROR STATISTICS (E.G., ERRORS/IMPROVEMENT/BIAS/FSP OF TRACK, INTENSITY, PRESSURE, TC SIZE)
  2) ASSIMILATED OBSERVATION GRAPHICS (I.E., THE EARTH-RELATIVE AND STORM-RELATIVE LOCATION OF THE OBSERVATION TYPE YOU ARE TESTING) 
  3) STORM-CENTERED DIFFERENCES OF ANY FIELD OUTPUTTED BY THE MODEL
MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS PACKAGE CAN BE USED WITH ANY NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS, WITH USER INPUT BEING CONFINED TO A BRIEF NAMELIST - EVERYTHING ELSE IS AUTOMATED.

%%  KEY POINTS  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

VERIFICATION CAPABILITY:
Every time you run this capability, if you ran the capability for the same set of experiments previously, those results are deleted. This is to ensure that your results include the most up-to-date data.

GRB CAPABILITY:
1) Only the SYNOPTIC and STORM grids are used for the grb capability. 
      A) The SYNOPTIC grid covers the same domain as the GLOBAL grid, but has a higher resolution than the GLOBAL grid.
      B) The STORM grid has the same resolution as the CORE grid, but has a larger domain than the CORE grid.
2) In the HWRFDA section, since the output of the pre-GSI and post-GSI grids are on hybrid levels, plan-view graphics and azimuthally-averaged graphics are taken at the average pressure over ocean in the entire domain at each level. This caveat is not written on graphics to save space, but an asterik is included next to the word "Pressure" so that a note can be included in a caption or on a slide.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  NEW ADDITIONS!  %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

4/25/23  | Added new capability to plot 1) boxplots of MAE for each experiment at all lead times and 2) histograms of MAE & bias for all experiments at each lead time
	 | Added compatibility to run GROOT-H with adecks
4/7/23   | Enabled GROOT compatibility with HAFS output files
		Added new retrieval script
		Added new code to read and process any number of conventional observations from HAFS (HWRF code still enabled - switches in namelist added)
		Updated runverif and editverif to handle HAFS runs
         | Added AL and EP final bdecks for 2022
3/20/23	 | Enabled new-subset stratification to take both the TC id and the TC cycle
1/16/23  | Enabled GROOT compatibility with R2022b version of Matlab that was included on Hera as of the 1/10/23 maintenance
	 | Ensured that if running a case study, the composite batch scripts would not be submitted - previously they were submited anyway even though there was nothing to composite
	 | Fixed some bugs with the new track vs. VMAX correlation: 1) filename now has experiment, 2) experiment is in title bar, and 3) graphic now works if no stat. sig. points
12/22/22 | Enabled title header for samples of >5 or >10 years to be compressed
	 | Enabled TC-by-TC, #fcsts, and PPC graphics to have adaptive font sizes as a function of the number of years in the sample
	 | Added the capability to calculate the track vs. VMAX correlation for each stratification
12/19/22 | Extended the bdeck/ catalog back through 2010
12/15/22 | Modified labeling of consistency metric, for clarity, from "consistent" to "fully consistent".
	 | Modified labeling of experiment with highest and lowest degree of consistent improvmeent to be highest and lowst degree of consistency - HDC and LDC, respectively.
11/20/22 | Added ability to stratify by cycles that satisfy the HFIP-RI definition (https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/6/683/htm)
         | Modified the scorecard to include the consistency-metric outcomes
         | Modified titles to be more consistent
11/16/22 | Removed "-Associated" from all graphics titles
	 | Changed folder names from NAMEYY to NAME##BYY to account for TCs within a given basin that cross sub-basins and retain the same name (e.g., SETH04P and SETH04S in 2022)
         | Fixed aesthetic bug with PPC graphics where TCs that crossed basins and retained the same name ended up being out of number/alphabetical order 
10/26/22 | Added capability to stratify by covariance type. 
                This functionality is primarily for HWRF and related models that can use HWRF-cycled covariance on D03. There are three new namelist items associated with this addition. 
		If you use the retrieval scripts to grab down files for GROOT, a new file will be created for each cycle of each TC identifying whether HWRF-cycled covariance was used.
		If you did not use the retrieval scripts, there is still another option to stratify by covariance type. Once a TDR file is avilable, HWRF uses HWRF-cycled covariance.                                 Thus, the other option in the namelist (if turned on) identifies the first cycle in a TC where a TDR file is present and marks that and every cycle thereafter                                 through the dissipation of the TC as one that used HWRF-cycled covariance.  
	 | Added capability for HDCI and LDCI to include the actual consistency score on the errskill graphics to understand the relative difference between HDCI and LDCI
10/6/22  | Added capability to plot TC-by-TC consistency-metric graphics
9/15/22  | Removed statistical significance from package
		The significance test typically used is a parametric test (paired t-test). Yet, distributions are often skewed, so this violates the test assumptions. 
		Given the consistency metric, which does not rely on a normal distribution, no significance test is needed, as consistency identifies which lead times to trust.
	 | Enabled IO and SH in the composite scripts by accounting for different basin identifiers (e.g., IO can have the basin identifier of both a and b) 
	 | Removed issue which didn't allow for hyphenated TC names
8/31/22  | Made modifications to conventional graphics scripts to allow subobtypes that had data in only some cycles to be included in graphics
8/24/22  | Added capability for retrieval script to process multple obtypes and subobtypes and for GROOT to plot them
	 | Retrieval script now grabs both anl and ges files
7/25/22  | Added capability to plot time-lag correlation of composited variables in order to better select a time threshold for the interpolator when generating early-model forecasts
	 | Cleaned up way GROOT saved files in cases/ and output/ 
7/15/22  | Removed hard coding for atcfunix file names
	 | Fixed a bug that arranged the composite by-TC graphics alphabetically instead of by stormid - quantatative resutls are identical, only aesthetics changed
	 | Rearranged github directories to get rid of GROOT/GROOT/ issue when pulling from github - you might need to do a clean pull!
	 | Added capability to do verification on HAFS output, where atcf files start with the storm ID and basin (e.g., 05AL) instead of the storm name (e.g., dorian05l)
6/14/22  | Added # fcst axes to blank graphics so the aspect ration is identical to non-blank graphics when saving to eps
	 | Changed titles on nearly all figures to be more accurate (e.g., Mean Error > MAE)
	 | Changed "STORM" to "TC" on all figures for consistency
	 | Changed "# 6-h fcsts" to "# lead times", for clarity, on the cycle-by-cycle graphics
	 | For projects with at least 3 experiments, added a new capability to identify the experiment with the lowest degree of consistency (LDCI)
6/8/22   | Added capability to plot TC-by-TC FSP graphics
	 | Added the newly released SHIPS data for 2020 storms for usage in the shear stratifications
	 | Added in bdecks for 2021 storms
	 | Removed 90% significance indicators, for clarity - kept 95%, only
5/25/22  | For projects with at least 3 experiments, added a new capability to identify the experiment with the highest degree of consistency (HDCI)
	 | Modified consistency metric graphics to include value of the "degree of consistency"
	 | For reader-comprehension purposes, switched labels RTSF, RSF, and RHF back to R34, R50, and R64 - they're still in m/s but their acronym is easier to comprehend
4/26/22  | Added a switch to automatically place the consistency metric on the error/skill combo plots for both mean and median - it automatically resizes based on the number of experiments
	 | Changed the xaxis labels to "strings" so that they would be centered on the tick marks
	 | Changed CONSISTENCYSCORECARD graphics to 1) include RMW and 2) to  extend to the same x-axis limit as the error/skill graphics
         | Enabled the location of the results output to be a different folder than the running folder
4/19/22  | Fixed a bug where the yaxis labels for the skill graphics weren't centered around 0
4/11/22  | Changed "Wind Speed" to "VMAX" and "Pressure" to "PMIN"
3/28/22  | Added a switch to save files as either eps or png
3/16/22  | Added the newly released SHIPS data for 2020 storms for usage in the shear stratifications
2/14/22  | Switched wind speed from knots to m/s, since km is used elsewhere throughougt the package
	 | Added a switch to only keep cases where at the initialization and verifying time the storm was over ocean
	 | Renamed R34, R50, and R64 to RTSF, RSF, and RHF to be consistent with the new m/s units 
2/6/22   | Minor aesthetic fixed (e.g., switched text file name to match stratification name)
	 | Modified how track bias graphics were being produced to fall under "trk" file names
1/31/22  | Added median error and improvement to "scorecard" graphics
	 | Added a "consistency scorecard" which identifies at each forecast lead time how consistent the results are based on 3 metrics - see User's Guide for more details
12/30/21 | Enlarged the sample size text from 10 to 14
	 | Fixed a bug with the cycle-by-cycle error graphics for across-error and along-track error
	 | Made the graphic naming convention for pressure consistent (prior: press or pres | current: prs)
	 | Fixed a bug with the "generate your own subset" code
11/30/21 | Added capability to plot the mean and median storm-by-storm improvement (multiple storms) and cycle-by-cycle improvement (individual storm)
	 | Fixed a bug with the PPC graphics so that forecast hours without data plot as blanks instead of 0%
	 | Added "Mean" and "Median" title identifiers to the 1) Error and Improvement and 2) Storm-By-Storm graphics
	 | Fixed a bug to ensure that R34-R64 and FSP Removed were homogeneous samples
11/18/21 | Added capability to calculate the separation time between serially-correlated forecasts at each forecsat hour based on a user-designated explained variance threshold in the namel           ist in order to calculate an effective sample size for use in statistical significance calculations
	 | Updated the bdecks to the latest output, fixed missing data for storm names, and grabbed JTWC bdecks for IO, SH, and WP which has TC category designation
11/1/21  | Added capability for customization of the end limit of the forecast lead time x-axes.
10/28/21 | Added capability for the combo error/improvement graphics to produce both a mean and a median version as another way aside from FSP and PPC graphics to identify sample outliers
	 | Added capability to choose what serial correlation value to use in the namelist
	 | Added capability to choose what obstype to use in the namelist
	 | Due to changes to Hera, GRB scripts now include an --exclusive flag so that memory issues do not occur
	 | GRB scripts have been modified so that each experiment is run in a separate batch script so timeouts don't occur
10/18/21 | Fixed a bug that included SS and SD in the TD and TS stratifications
	 | Flipped the y-axis for the individual cycle graphics to match the PPC graphics
	 | Added capability to keep folders of invests or storms that do not satisfy NHC verfication
	 | Confirmed that the OBS/ folder graphics included all storms not just those that satisfied NHC verification
9/20/21  | Optimized code to use less resources, fixed bug that didn't allow storms with 1 cycle completed to plot, added a switch to turn off lagged correlation graphics to save time, 
           changed the errorskill graphic's aspect ratio to match those of other graphics, modified track graphics to be same resolution as other graphics and included additional guidance
7/30/21  | Added a new graphic that shows a "scorecard" of the error, improvement, bias, fsp, # fcsts, and stat. sig. for 7 variables (track, wind speed, mslp, R34, R50, R64, & RMW. 
           A huge thank you and shoutout to Dr. Peter Marinescu for originating the idea and generating the base code for the scorecard that I then modified for integration into GROOT! 
6/22/21  | Added a new graphic that shows the percentage point contribution (PPC) of each cycle to the full storm AND for each storm to the composite improvement
	 | Modified the batch scripts to break up the composite script where only 20 subsets run per batch job so that the wall clock time doesn't run out
	 | Modified the blank graphics capability when not enough data is available so that an equal number of graphics are generated for each storm and for each basin
6/09/21  | Added a new graphic that shows the percent contribution of each cycle to each storm's error - this helps the user understand which cycle might be driving the storm errors
         | Added new graphics to identify the lagged correlation in the model for each storm and overall for every variable and subset
	 | Added the ability to have track w/ assimilated obs graphics for each experiment, not just overall
	 | Modified the error & improvement combined graphic so that the aspect ratio of each are identical
	 | Modified the individual storm xlim range to match the max forecast length for easier comparision between storms
	 | Various bug fixes and minor changes (e.g., subsets with -B > -P for basin-scale models to indicate parent domain, for clarity) 
4/23/21  | Imported SHIPS data to generate shear stratifications for SHDC: 850-200 hPa shear magnitude (kt) with vortex removed and averaged from 0-500 km relative to 850 hPa vortex center
	   Stratifications include LOW (lower quartile), MOD (interquartile range), and HIGH (upper quartile), where values are determined by the t=0 climatology for each basin separately
	 | Significantly sped up script execution
4/14/21  | Added some new subsets for basin models 
	 | Added the ability to plot an empty graphic if a subset has no data
	 | Made a nomenclature change: MN > H12 & MJ > H345
	 | Added a new graphic that shows the number of cycles from each storm that contributes to a graphic each forecast hour
	 | Fixed a bug that occured for some "by cycle" subset graphics - this did not impact composite graphics
3/26/21  | A new graphic type which depicts both error & improvement - this is useful if you have a lot of examples you want to show in a small space (either presentation or paper)
3/10/21  | RI, IN, SS, WK, and RW intensity change stratifications are now available. 
           NOTE: For the BT of a given storm, a running -6 h to +6 h intensity change is calculated to capture what type of intensity change the storm is currently undergoing. 
		 Then, for cycles where at t=0 that value is...
		 x>=15 kt: categorize as RI
		 5<=x<15 kt: categorize as IN
		 -5<x<5 kt: categorize as SS
		 -15<x<=5 kt: categorize as WK
		 x<=-15 kt: categorize as RW
         | A bug fix which impacted basin-scale models when generating composite graphics of assmilated observations - it now takes into account storms in the entire basin
	 | The y-axes for a given variable will be identical for all stratifications not just within one basin, but across all basins in your sample for easier comparision
2/09/21  | Package v1.0.0 ready for distribution to OSA!
